# AMZ_UnitEconomics

The dashboard offers an ASIN-level view of in-stock products as of the latest snapshot date.

The Amazon Unit Economics Dashboard serves the purpose of tracking and analyzing Amazon costs, unit prices (excluding VAT if applicable), COGS, and their relation to payout.
With this dashboard, Brand Managers can identify areas of concern, such as high FBA fees and COGS percentages compared to current sales prices, and take actions to improve the final payout.

**BEST PRACTICES**
BM / ROMs should check weekly for ASINs / SKUs where the payout % is less than 25%. 
As Payout % is only unit economics, we have to count with other costs of PPC, 3PL, discounts, deals, marketing, etc. when we are establishing our final profitability of the product. 
Any product should have these low margins only if discontinued, have excess inventory strategy or other removal strategy.

When payout % is too low outside the above mentioned exceptions:
 * Check pricing and identify opportunity to increase price
 * If price cannot be increased due to competition / BSR, etc. then check we need to investigate FBA fee % and COGS % and check if any of them could be decreased with new packaging option or new sourcing option 
   -> long term strategy
 * If any of the above are possible BM to identify if this ASIN needs to be sunsetted
